Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.

Follow these steps to solve this challenge:
- Download the `sql-murder-mystery.db` file 
- click on file, then open db and load in the database file you downloaded above
- write your SQL queries to see the different tables and the content
- use the schema diagram to navigate the different tables
- figure out who committed the crime with the details you remembered above
