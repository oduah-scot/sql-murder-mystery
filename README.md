### Data Analysis Project

Project Questions
1. create a chart to show the 10 least loyal customers
2. What percentage of sales come from each outlet type
3. What producers account for the 5 lowest sales figure
4. Averae order quantity per category group
5. make a chart showing the shipping status by outlet type

7. most popular states by sales channel 
8. 10 VIP customers
9. percentage of sales volume by sales channel and country
10. Display sales figure by order category
NOTE: You need to derive a column that shows the sales figure.
The unit price column is in naira (NGN) and south african rand (ZAR), depending on the country the sales was made. You might need to convert to dollars as all analysis should be in dollars
The exchange rate is in the Details sheet
You need to generate another column that shows order category to answer question 10 above using this rule:
Order quantity between 0-100 falls under 'Low End' orders
Order quantity between 101-300 falls under 'Mid End' orders
Order quantity between 301-1000 falls under 'High End' orders
