### Sql Murder Mystery Project
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan.15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.

Follow these steps to solve this challenge:
- Download the `sql-murder-mystery.db` file 
- visit www.sqliteonline.com
- click on file, then open db and load in the database file you downloaded above
- write your SQL queries to see the different tables and the content
- use the schema diagram to navigate the different tables
- figure out who committed the crime with the details you remembered above
- show a txt document that contains your thought process, narrative and SQL codes written to arrive at the solution to the murder mystery
